Setting up settings panel with Vuetify
- Took roughly over 1 hour
- Vuetify instantiates wrappers for when the HTML template is rendered to the screen, meaning that if you want to have control over padding for the wrappers you have to set them in a separate .CSS file. For some reason doing it within the `style` tag of a `.vue` SFC doesn't work.
- Will need to consider what UI design I want to go for and reconsider using Vuetify
