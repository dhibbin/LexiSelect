Morning meeting
- Took roughly 25 mins
- Discussed problems encountered on Friday and plans for the project
- Must develop ideas for a featureset ideal for creative writers

Fixing the prototype and getting changing tokens to work
- Took roughly 1.5 hours
- Dealt with array copying problems by parsing through the array and pushing elements to another array
- Turns out I was passing the wrong index to the `GenerateWithNewToken()` which meant I wasn't correctly changing the token in the previous output
