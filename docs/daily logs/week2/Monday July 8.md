Morning meeting
- Took roughly 25 mins
- Discussed problems encountered on Friday and plans for the project
- Must develop ideas for a featureset ideal for creative writers

Fixing the prototype and getting changing tokens to work
- Took roughly 1.5 hours
- Dealt with array copying problems by parsing through the array and pushing elements to another array
- Turns out I was passing the wrong index to the `GenerateWithNewToken()` which meant I wasn't correctly changing the token in the previous output

Researching JS frameworks
- Took roughly 3 hours
- After readings several articles and watching several videos on the process of building apps using React/Angular/VueJS, I concluded that VueJS was the best choice for the project
- Primarily because it is the easiest to learn, while still being widely used and suited to a solo project

Researching UI component libraries
- Took roughly 30 mins
- At the moment I am still undecided, it will probably be between a component library specifically designed for VueJS, like Vuetify, or Bootstrap since I have already familiarised myself with it this past week.
