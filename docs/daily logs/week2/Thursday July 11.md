Forcing strict typing in typescript part 1
- Took 1.5 hours
- Tried changing tsconfig.json and other tsconfig VueJS files to force strict and explicit typing in all code files
- Tried installing ESLint with a typescript plugin to require types
- None of these works and I can declare new variables without typing their type
- This shouldn't have taken this long and will return to developing the page
