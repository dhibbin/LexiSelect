Researched which UI component library to use
- Took roughly 1 hour
- Unfortunately Bootstrap-Vue is only designed to be compatible with Bootstrap v4 and Vue 2, however it does work with Vue 3 using a compatibility mode. Ultimately I decided it would be best to try out a different UI component library.  
- Watched videos overviewing how both Vuetify and Quasar handle and read articles comparing commonly used UI frameworks for VueJS 
- Concluded that Quasar would a good first choice and too see how it works out initially.
