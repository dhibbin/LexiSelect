Continuing to make intractable text
- Took roughly 1.3 hours
- Since the text tree uses a monospace font, the span tags can be offset using the number of characters that appear before them in the input box
- Searched through the Vuetify docs to find the appropriate choice for displaying the alternative tokens. Settled on the expansion panel and tried to get it instantiated for each span tag correctly 
- Will need to set up objects to hold all of the data together instead of using separate arrays
