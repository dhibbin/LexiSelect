Morning meeting
- Took roughly 1 hour
- Discussed findings from the research and where to take the project
- Agreed that the simplicity of the implementation means that there isn't a point tying this project to any particular front end
- Decided to develop a prototype in plain HTML/CSS/JS without any frameworks 

Setup UI for prototype
- Took roughly 4 hours
- Been a long time since I last used HTML/CSS with Bootstrap, getting back to grips with it
- Grabbed some examples off the internet of sidebars and went through them to understand how they work before making my own

- Took roughly 30 mins

Todo:
- Setup a system for interactive text that horizontally scrolls
- Fix the CSS so that the webpage doesn't continue extending
