# Wednesday July 3

Morning meeting
- Took roughly 1 hour
- Discussed findings from the research and where to take the project
- Agreed that the simplicity of the implementation means that there isn't a point tying this project to any particular front end
- Decided to develop a prototype in plain HTML/CSS/JS without any frameworks
