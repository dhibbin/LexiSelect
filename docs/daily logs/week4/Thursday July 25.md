Linking textareas to their branch
- Took roughly 1.5 hours
- Wrote up a function that goes through the textarea when its contents are modified, finding the modified token and updating the content of the respective token in that branch of the TextTree SFC
- Some problems with displaying alternative tokens after modification that need to be addressed
