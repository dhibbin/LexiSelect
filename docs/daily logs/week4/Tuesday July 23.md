Trying to access Vuetify DOM elements
- Took roughly 2 hours
- Many guides online explained that using the `ref=` argument would allow you to access the DOM element within the script of the SFC
- However attempting to do this with Vuetify components didn't work
- I set up a test component to try it with default HTML elements and it worked
- I figured out what I needed to do to get references to Vuetify DOM elements and will try to lerp the height
- Also set up a delay for collapsing the alternative token menu so you can move the mouse around without it closing instantly
