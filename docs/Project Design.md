# Project Design

The project is made up of 4 Vue single-file-components and 4 typescript files

## SideBar.vue

Contains multiple expansion panels with input fields that allows the user to change the settings used by the LLMService singleton. 
Whenever any of the fields are updated, the SideBar tries to update the settings used by LLMService. The settings is only updated if all of its values pass the rules defined in LLMSettingsWrapper.

## TextBar.vue

Contains two tabs for the user
- Input tab
	- Contains two textareas for the user prompt and system prompt and a button to create a new branch
- Output tab
	- Contains a textarea for every TextBranch in the TextTree. Each textarea has a continue generation button and a remove button below it

## TextTree.vue

Acts as a parent component for all of the TextBranches on the page. Handles receiving new inputs from the LLM and from the user.

## TextBranch .vue

Contains a list of tokens generated by the LLM.
