# Key Decisions

## Week 1

Which AI front end should be used?
- See [Investigating AI Frontends](https://github.com/dhibbin/LexiSelect/blob/main/docs/research/Investigating%20AI%20Frontends.md)
- Conclusion: Text-Generation-WebUI is likely the best front end if I am going to use someone else's AI front end. 

Should this be developed as a browser extension?
